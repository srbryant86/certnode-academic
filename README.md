CertNode: A Computational Framework for Logic Validation and Epistemic Trust

The rapid proliferation of digital content has made it increasingly difficult to evaluate the reasoning quality and epistemic reliability of public communication. CertNode is a computational framework that analyzes the logical structure and rhetorical properties of written text, producing verifiable, audit‑grade certifications of argument integrity. Unlike fact‑checking tools or moderation systems, CertNode does not assess truth claims. Instead, it provides a structured evaluation of reasoning clarity, fallacy occurrence, and persuasive intensity, generating cryptographically signed output records for transparent verification.

The system’s architecture combines logic mapping, fallacy detection, and verifiable output certification into a neutral infrastructure layer designed to support research, journalism, and enterprise information auditing. By making logical evaluations machine‑assisted and reproducible, CertNode can enhance trust in digital communication without imposing editorial control or ideological bias.This framework provides a foundation for future applications in academic peer review, media integrity, and automated reasoning literacy initiatives.

CertNode is a computational framework for evaluating the logical structure and rhetorical properties of written content. 
It is designed as an **infrastructure-level tool** to support research, media integrity, and institutional trust without acting as a gatekeeper or fact-checking authority.

## Overview

CertNode analyzes text in three stages:

1. **Logical Structure Mapping**  
   Identifies claims, evidence, and the relationships between them.

2. **Fallacy and Rhetorical Pattern Detection**  
   Highlights reasoning errors or persuasive techniques that may influence interpretation.

3. **Verifiable Certification**  
   Generates a cryptographically signed evaluation record for transparency and auditability.

The system is intended to be **neutral, reproducible, and research-oriented**, serving academic, journalistic, and enterprise applications.

## Key Features

- **Logic and Rhetorical Analysis**  
  Evaluates argument clarity, structure, and the presence of manipulative framing.

- **Certified Outputs**  
  Produces JSON-based evaluation reports with cryptographic hash sealing for verifiable records.

- **API and CLI**  
  Supports both programmatic and command-line access for batch or on-demand analysis.

- **Integration-Ready**  
  Compatible with CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployment, and agent-based systems.

## Example Certified Output

```json
{
  "capsule_hash": "SHA256...",
  "logic_structure_score": 0.82,
  "fallacy_flags": ["ad_hominem"],
  "rhetorical_intensity": "moderate",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T13:00:00Z",
  "validation_passed": true
}
```

This output can be independently verified to ensure that evaluations have not been altered post-generation.
